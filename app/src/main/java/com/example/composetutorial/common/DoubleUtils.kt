// could all want to use this code and we don't really want to duplicate it. Can/should we have
// an object which is included by composition in all ViewModels that want it? Inheritance? Something
// else?
// TODO: There might be an argument for *not* allowing grouping characters in strings - not just
// here, perhaps we even would always allow them here, but maybe more in TextFields. If a user is
// mixing different "regions", they might get confused and type "." when the decimal separator is
// "," or vice versa and enter junk, whereas if typing "." when it isn't the decimal separator is
// discarded it's a little more obvious. Maybe this isn't a concern, given the device's region is
// what (I think) matters here, not the dataSet's setting, so the user will always be using their
// native symbols. This could be a setting of course but don't rush to make it one.
