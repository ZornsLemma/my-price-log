Tracks prices of products at local stores and compares them. Works entirely offline:
<ul>
<li>You enter a list of stores.</li>
<li>You enter a list of products sold at those stores.</li>
<li>You enter, update and confirm the prices of those products at those stores as you shop.</li>
<li>The app shows you the unit price of a product at all the stores which sell it, allowing you to decide where to buy it.</li>
</ul>

The user interface is designed for minimal fuss when you're standing in the supermarket aisle with a basket in one hand and your phone in the other.

Unit conversions are handled automatically with support for metric, imperial and US customary units.

How long ago a price was last updated is tracked automatically so you won't be misled by out-of-date prices.
